## Introduction

This project demonstrates Git version control concept and collaboration skills acquired during My Darey.io Adventure.

## Local Environment Setup

Below highlights the step to setup local environment
- install Git and Create a Github account
- Create remote repository
- Clone the remote repository to your local environment
- Navigate to the project directory
- Create branches for the different chapter of the web story

## Navigation

Navigate through the story by selecting the hyperlinked options at the end of each chapter.

- [Chapter 1](./chapter-1.md)
- [Chapter 2](./chapter-2.md)
- [Chapter 3](./chapter-3.md)

## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts were not excluded during making the web story. A line was changed in one of the branches and it was observed that it's not inline with the main branch. Hence resolving the conflict is mandatory for a successfull completion of the web story. Below highlights the step followed to resolve the conflict
- git fetch (fetches the file with conflict)
- git pull (pull to the local repository for correction)
- git add ., git commit -m (to add the changes and commit)
- git merge ( merge the feature branch with the main branch)
- git push ( push to remote repository)

## Acknowledgments

Thank you for being a part of this Git adventure! Your contributions make the story come alive.
